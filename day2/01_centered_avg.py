# Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values,

# what data type are we expecting to return?
# int / float?
# return an int

"""
1. Take numbers from list and add them together 
after extrapolating the smallest and largest numbers in to their own variables
2. take the sum of the numbers and minus the max of the list
3. take what is left and minus the min of the list

get the smallest value from the list
get the largest value from the list

make a sum / counter variable and set it to zero
loop over each number in our list
    sum up all of the numbers

use the algorithm (sum = sum - largest - smallest)

apply the algorithm of sum divided by the length of our list minus two
